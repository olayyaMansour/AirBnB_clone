# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone, starting with the development of a command interpreter. The command interpreter allows users to manage objects related to the AirBnB project, such as creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter works in both interactive and non-interactive modes. In interactive mode, users can input commands and get immediate responses. In non-interactive mode, commands can be passed through standard input.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter in interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py
